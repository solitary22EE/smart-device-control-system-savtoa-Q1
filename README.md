# Simple Smart Device Control System (Python)

This project demonstrates basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python by building a simple and scalable smart device control system.

---

## 📌 Features
- Control different devices using a common interface
- Easily extendable to add new devices
- Safe internal state management (ON / OFF)
- Clean and readable code structure

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
- **Abstraction** – Base `Device` class
- **Encapsulation** – Internal device state protected
- **Inheritance** – `Motor` and `Light` inherit from `Device`
- **Polymorphism** – Controller works with any device type

---

## 🔧 Devices Implemented
- **Motor**
  - Motor has started
  - Motor has stopped
- **Light**
  - Light switched on
  - Light switched off
